# Arabic Reading Assistant
##Synopsis

This assistant visually guides an emergent reader through the feature parts (letters) of a complex composite (word), and then provides TTS audio of the pronunciation. The translation of the Arabic word into English is also provided. This is essentially an enhanced flashcard for language study, providing features based on nueroscience principles being researched at Sara.AI

## Motivation

As a personal experiment in accellerated reading through Intelligence Amplification, I am building this personal assistant for my journey of learning Arabic. Intelligence Amplification leverages computing power to amplify human capabilities. Rather than expending effort into learning phonetic rules for constructing Arabic word-sounds from Arabic graphemes, developing my mind into an Arabic TTS machine, I am outsourcing this computing to a machine and allowing innate Human Intelligence to focus on pattern recognition. This allows the mind to focus on visual, auditory, and meaning association in the Temporal lobe without the distraction of puzzle solving in the Parietal lobe.
